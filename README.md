Welcome to my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
In this task, I have analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
The goal is to visualize accident hotspots and determine key contributing factors behind accidents.



ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used contains detailed records of road traffic accidents, including:

Date and Time of Accident

Weather Conditions

Road Surface Conditions

Light Conditions

Vehicle and Casualty Information

Accident Severity






ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used

Google Colab

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn





ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Visualization

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Converted date and time columns into usable formats

Encoded categorical variables for analysis


ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed accident frequency based on weather conditions, road surface, and time of day

Identified accident hotspots and high-risk conditions

Created visualizations using bar charts, heatmaps, and line plots




âœ… Conclusion

This analysis helps in understanding the major factors contributing to road accidents.
The insights gained can be used to improve road safety measures, traffic management, and driver awareness programs.

Thank you for reviewingÂ myÂ submission!
